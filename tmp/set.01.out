GO:0015291	0.0009129935078964033	3	3/4	Enables the transfer of a solute from one side of a membrane to the other, up its concentration gradient. The transporter binds the solute and undergoes a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction and is driven by a chemiosmotic source of energy, not direct ATP coupling. Secondary active transporters include symporters and antiporters.	b0813, b2663, b1336
